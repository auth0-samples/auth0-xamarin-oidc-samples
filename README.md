## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like
* Google
* Facebook
* Microsoft
* Linkedin
* GitHub
* Twitter
* Box
* Salesforce
* etc.

**or** enterprise identity systems like:
* Windows Azure AD
* Google Apps
* Active Directory
* ADFS
* Any SAML Identity Provider

* Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)
* Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts) with the same user
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and create user identity flow securely
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in
* Pull data from other sources and add it to user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules)
